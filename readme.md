Horiseon Refactor challenge

Published site: https://seangenge.github.io/01---Horiseon/

Refactored the code by
 - Adding comments to index.html
 - Adding comments to style.css
 - Combining some of the css elements into one to reduce duplication since it was not needed
 - Added alt text for all images and icons
 - Grouped up the css elements into different sections so it is easier to make future changes. If this was a larger website then this could potentially be split up into multiple css files but only if required
 - Made the index.html file a bit more readable and easier to see the different sections
